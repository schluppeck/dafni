## Scanner - actual numbers from the day (2017/18)

2. **inplane anatomy** - T1w, 2D MPRAGE. 24 slices, inplane voxel size: 1.5 mm, slice thickness 3 mm (same prescription as fMRI data). Matrix size 128 x 128.
4. **fMRI data** (and all fMRI scans) 2D gradient-echo EPI, TR 1.5s, TE 40ms, FA: 72º, 160 dynamics. Voxel size 3mm isotropic. Matrix size 64 x 64.
6. **whole head anatomy** - T1w 3D MPRAGE. Matrix size 256 x 256, 160 slices. Reconstructed as sagittal images. voxel size 1 mm isotropic. TE 3.7 ms, TR 8.13 ms, FA 8°, TI 960 ms, and linear phase encoding order.

## Stimulus set-up

- stimuli were presented on a BOLDscreen (CRS Ltd, Rochester, UK) - https://www.crsltd.com/tools-for-functional-imaging/mr-safe-displays/boldscreen-32-lcd-for-fmri/
- **2018/19 stimulus code:** inspect ``scene_localiser()`` in the ``stimulusCode`` directory. If you can't run the code and get errors, have a lootk at [this clip on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kSvEO4-HVc) to get an impression.
- other details have remained the same since the 2017/18 version.
