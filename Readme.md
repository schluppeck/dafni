## Summary

These are the materials for a *data analysis for neuroimaging* module [PSYG4043] at the University of Nottingham, a core module on the [*MSc Cognitive Neuroscience*](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/courses/psychology/cognitive-neuroscience-msc.aspx) (formerly ~~Brain Imaging~~).


In the class, we acquire various MRI data sets - (emphasis on fMRI, anatomical, and/or DTI) in small groups. We then use a combination of tools to analyse the data.

The module is for *10 credits* and runs for seven 2h sessions. (First iteration of the course Feb. 2017).
