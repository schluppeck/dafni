## Scanner - actual numbers from the day (2022/23).

For each of four subjects (``sub-01`` .. ``sub-02``) we collected most of those scans. Look at the `Readme.md` file in each folder for any notes (eg `sub-02` has one scan with TR=2s, because of the sample protocol I had picked.) 

Data shared via `OneDrive` link on a moodle message to the participants on the module.

### A note on the block-design parameters.

- the visual scan (faces versus objects) used a `rest-A-rest-B-...` pattern.
- the finger tapping scan follwed the same timing. `rest-LEFT-rest-RIGHT...`

Each `rest-stimulus` block took 24s (so 16 TRs at 1.5s... or 12 TRs for the one scan with a 2s TR).

The code for these experiments is in the `stimulusCode` folder (`FFAlocaliser()` and `M1localiser()`). Ask DS for details on how this works, if you are interested in generating stimuli.
