# Looking at time series - linear regression reprise

JJ

The aims of this lesson are. Use `spm` and assorted tools (in `matlab` if you want) to:

- load in 4d image (nifti) and select out a particular voxel's timecourse
- inspect the data that gives rise to the design matrix again. Where is that information stored in `spm`? Can you make a figure of it?
- Go through the logic of how how *t-stat* is calculated, given $\beta$-weights, residuals, design matrix and contrast vector.

*Think about storing your work in a script, so you can modify and adjust it later.*

*Can you find a way to turn some of this information into a figure for your report?*
